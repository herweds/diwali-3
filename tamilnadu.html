<p>Deepavali in Tamil nadu is celebrated spiritually,</p>
<p> The mornings of Deepavali are started with an oil bath which signifies the removal of impurities. The snacks in the shops are emptied as the stalls are flooded with customers.
In the end, crackers are lit and the roads are sparkling with the light and joy brought by the crackers.</p>
